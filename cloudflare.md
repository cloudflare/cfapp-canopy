# Canopy (Beta)

Canopy is an innovative ad unit that allows any publisher to generate incremental revenue with little effort. It is complementary to existing ad units, can be enabled with a single click and is available exclusively to CloudFlare publishers (subject to approval).  The Slider also includes numerous configuration options that allow you to control the level of interaction with your site’s visitors. 
    
## Features


**Generate Incremental revenue with minimal effort.**  The Slider—an IAB standard 300x250 medium rectangle—elegantly slides onto the page after one second of visitor engagement drawing visitor attention and generating engagement rates several times that of similar native ad units. The end result is higher yield and more revenue for publishers. 


**Access to Top Advertisers.**  Get instantaneous access to many of the world’s largest marketplaces for advertisers. No matter how small or large, or broad or niche your website is—we have advertisers appropriate for your content.


**Yield Optimization.**   Our advertiser partners compete in real-time within our ad decisioning engine to ensure that your inventory captures substantial demand at the highest possible yield. Multiple relevant advertisers participate in real-time auctions to deliver the highest paying ads for every single impression.


    Note: the Slider will not appear on pages viewed on mobile browsers
